# ML_Churn_Modelling

This python program is an adaptation from a SUPERB article of <br>
"Implementation of Artificial Neural Network in Python" by Aqsa Zafar <br>(https://www.mltut.com/implementation-of-artificial-neural-network-in-python/)

The original article is written at (<i>my guess...</i>) python2 and I update some portion of it to python3 and its ascociated library.<br>
This python version was selected because the newest python version at the time (python 3.13) did not support tensorflow and keras module, yet.


### This program was tested at machine with below environment setting:
<ul>
<li>python 3.10.11</li>
<li>pandas 2.2.2</li>
<li>numpy 1.26.4</li>
<li>matplotlib 3.9.2</li>
<li>scikit-learn 1.5.1</li>
<li>tensorflow 2.17.0</li>
<li>keras 3.5.0</li>
</ul>
<br>

<i><b>Warning:</b><br> 
<ul>
<li>running this program on different version of python and/or library will possibly create different result / warning / error</li>
<li>Use this program at your own risk</li>
</ul></i>
